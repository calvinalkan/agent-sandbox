hardness: codex:gpt-5.2

Carefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features, etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more compelling/useful, etc.

For each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along with the git-diff style changes relative to the original markdown. 
Do not modify the original plan, instea, present your findings, one at a time, so that we can
review (and maybe apply) them sequentially. Your first message should also include the 
total number of proposed revisions.

The original plan is:

$@
